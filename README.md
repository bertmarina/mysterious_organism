# Mysterious Organism  

This project is part of the **Full-Stack Engineer** course on codecademy.com  
  
## Project Goals  
The aim of the project is to create objects that simulate the DNA of *P. Aequor*.  
To create objects easily, a factory function is used. The function returns an ID number and an array with the DNA sequence. In addition, three methods are created.  
The two helper functions at the beginning are already provided.  

To finish the project, an array containing 30 *P. Aequor* that can survive is created.  
 
*The instructions do not provide step by step guidelines but only the requirements.*  
  
Every function has detailed comments explaining the purpose.
